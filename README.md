# SORTING-SEARCHING
This repositroy contains C programming codes for searching and sorting. 

EXPERIMENT-1 {BASIC SEARCHING} 

1. Start the program.
2. Declare an integer array arr of size 5 and insert values. 
3. Declare an integer variable sv to store the search value entered by the user.
4. Display a message asking the user to enter the search value.
5. Read value entered by the user and store it in the variable sv using scanf() function.
6. Use a for loop to iterate through the array arr.
7. In the for loop, check if the current element of the array is equal to the search value entered.
8. If the current element of the array is equal to the search value, display a message "Number found" and return 0 to exit the program.
9. Else display a message "Number not found".
10. End the program.

EXPERIMENT-2 {BUBBLE SORT}

1. Start the program
2. Declare an integer array arr of size 5 and insert values. 
3. Declare integer variables for passes, comp, i, j, and temp.
4. Define a function called Bubble that takes an integer array. 
5. In the function Bubble, set passes to n-1 and comp to n-1.
6. Nested for loops to iterate through the array and compare adjacent elements.
7. If an adjacent element is greater than the current element, swap their positions.
8. Define another function called disp to display the sorted array.
9. In the function disp, use a for loop to iterate through the sorted array and display each element.
10. In the main function, call the Bubble function and pass the array and its size as input.
11. Then call the disp function to display the sorted array.
12. End the program.
